# Rescue the Hostage - Local Search Algorithms
This project is a Pygame-based simulation where the player (an AI agent) must rescue a hostage by navigating through a grid with obstacles. The game demonstrates the implementation of three local search algorithms: Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm. The goal is to find the optimal path to the hostage while avoiding obstacles and escaping potential loops.

## Features:
* **Grid-based environment** with randomly generated obstacles.

* **Three search algorithms** to choose from:

  * Hill Climbing

  * Simulated Annealing

  * Genetic Algorithm

* **Visualization** of the player, hostage, and obstacles using custom images.
